#  SOAR & EDR Threat Detection with LimaCharlie (In Progress)

üìù Summary:
This project showcases the implementation of LimaCharlie as an EDR solution for detecting and responding to security incidents. It focuses on automated detection and response integration within a SOAR framework.


üîç Key Implementation Steps:
Deploying LimaCharlie Agents on Windows endpoints for real-time security monitoring.
Configuring custom detection rules to identify threats such as:
- Unauthorized command execution (e.g, suspicious PowerShell and Command Line use).
- Privilege escalation attempts (e.g., running processes as SYSTEM).

Defining automated response actions, including:
- 	Isolating compromised hosts to prevent lateral movement.
- Killing suspicious processes before they execute malicious payloads.

SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)

- Orchestration: Integrates security tools (SIEM, firewalls, Anti-virus) for seamless communication.
- Automation: Reduces security analyst workload by handling repetitive tasks.
- Response: Uses playbooks for faster, consistent incident handling.

EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)

- Real-Time Monitoring: Detects suspicious endpoint activities (malware, unauthorized access).
- Threat Detection: Uses machine learning & behavioral analysis to spot known/unknown threats.
- Incident Investigation: Provides detailed logs for forensic analysis.
- Automated Responses: Can isolate compromised endpoints and kill malicious processes.
